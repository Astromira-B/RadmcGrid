# RadmcGrid
Radiative transfer grid using Radmc-3D for protoplanetary disk simulations.

# Installation requirements
In order for this package to workm some softwares are necessary:

- Radmc3dPy: The official Python interface for preparing and manag-
ing RADMC-3D input and output files.

Numpy: Essential for numerical computations and array manage-
ment.

-matplotlib: Used for creating plots and visualizing simulation out-
puts.

-astropy : Required for handling FITS files and astronomical data
formats.

-tqdm : Provides progress bars for tracking simulation execution.

-seaborn : Optional, but used for enhanced data visualization and
plotting aesthetics.
